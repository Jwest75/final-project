# Final Project 

### What My Site Will Be About 
This website will be a partial telling of my story. It will include a brief history of my life, what I do, and why I do it. I would also like to talk about some of the people who have inspired me along the way to be a better person and care about stuff that matters.

1. Who is this site for? 
    - This site will be for people who want to know more about me.
2. What do I want people to know/understand most after reading my site? 
    - I want people to understand that I am an imperfect work in progress.
3. What do I want people to feel when they visit my site?
    - I want people to feel they can trust me and I want people to laugh.
